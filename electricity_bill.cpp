An electricity board charges the following rates to domestic users to discourage large consumption of energy :
For the first 100 units - 50 P per unit
Beyond 300 units - 60 P per unit
If the total cost is more than Rs.250.00 then an additional surcharge of 15% is added on the difference. Define a class Electricity in which 
the function Bill computes the cost. Define a derived class More_Electricity and override Bill to add the surcharge.



class Electricity
{

private: 

int units;
int cost;

public:

   void Bill()
{
